            <h2>Poker Simulator</h2>
            <p>Have you ever wanted to know the odds that odds of winning with your hand? Do you ever watch a game of poker happening and wondering the odds of each person winning? Then my Poker Simulator is perfect for you.</p>
            <p>In the Java app, I programed a deck of cards and then had to program all the rules and classifications for poker. This includes determining what the best hand is and comparing each player's hands.</p>
