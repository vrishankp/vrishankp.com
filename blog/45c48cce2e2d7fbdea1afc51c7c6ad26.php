            <p>So pretty big updates to the website:
1. It is now linked directly to GitHub, so all the changes will be live and can be seen on GitHub.
2. A new, stronger, hashing algorithm is used to store passwords in the database. This greatly reduces the likelihood of a password leaking as a result of a data breach.

More updates coming soon (hopefully)</p>
