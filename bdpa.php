            <h2>BDPA example from 2017</h2>
            <p>This was the actual web application that we created in the  High School Coding Competition (HSCC) at the Black Data Processing Association (BDPA) in 2017. During the competition, we were given the task to design a financial website where customers could sign up and get a loan. Furthermore, they could see the price of the loan and the monthly payments and the total interest that they would pay. However, as we only had 7 hours to read, design, and program the entire application, but this project still managed to get 1st place in Coding. The following year we were given a new prompt, and we managed to get <a href="https://betf.org/" target="_blank">1st overall</a> and each of us won a $2,500 scholarship.

                To try this application out, you can click on all the links, or log in with the credentials <b>Username: "testUser"</b> and <b>Password: "Password101"</b>. This project is incomplete as the database wasn't able to be uploaded, so the loans and sign in page will work, but won't be updated in the database.
